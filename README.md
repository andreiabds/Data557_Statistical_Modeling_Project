# Data557_Statistical_Modeling_Project
This is the project for the DATA 557 - Applied Statistics and Experimental Design course at University of Washington, Seattle.

### Preliminary Proposal
Romantic relationships are ubiquitous in human life. In Western culture, monogamous relationships and marriage are seen as the norm. However, a commonly shared statistic is that 50% of marriages end in divorce. Hence, the question: what makes relationships successful? What features are highly correlated with long-lasting relationships? 

Some questions we might be interested in investigating related to this topic are:
Do the divorce/separation statistics hold true across different cities? Does location have an effect on the rates of divorce/separation amongst those interviewed? 
How does income/income disparity affect relationship outcomes over time? And does income disparity have the same effect in heterosexual couples as it does for LGBTQ couples?
How does education level affect relationships? Do relationships where women have a higher level of education than men last longer? Do big disparities in education affect the length of a relationship? Do couples with a higher level of education stay together longer than couples with lower education levels? 

#### Description of data:
We propose to use the dataset “How Couples Meet and Stay Together (HCMST)”. The dataset was collected from 2009 to 2015 by surveying 4,002 American respondents over five waves. Response to Wave 1 (main survey), in 2009,  was 71 percent. Response to Wave 2 (follow-up survey) one year later was 84 percent. Response to Wave 3 (follow-up survey) one year later was 72.9 percent. Response to Wave 4 (follow-up survey), in 2013, was 60 percent. The response rate to Wave 5 (follow-up survey), in 2015, was 46%. In total, the dataset has 4,002 observations with 534 features that include information such as marital status, sexuality, education level, income, and geographic location.

Both heterosexual and LGBTQ individuals were surveyed. Additionally, relationship status and marital status were recorded in each wave, so we can examine patterns over time. We currently have access to the public use portion of the dataset.
